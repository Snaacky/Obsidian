# Obsidian
Skin changer for CS:GO. [Obsidian does not currently work although a discussion exists to try and get the project functional.](https://github.com/Snaacky/Obsidian/discussions/2)

## Warning
Obsidian comes as is with no guarantees regarding its standing with VAC. This is a cheat and will most likely get you banned if you attempt to use it on any cheat protected servers. I have only tested Obsidian on private servers with VAC disabled and recommend you do the same. I do not encourage cheating in any form.

## Requirements
* [Python >= 3.5](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pymem](https://github.com/srounet/Pymem)
* [pywin32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/?source=navbar)
